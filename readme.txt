== Description ==

With this plugin you can change what PDF template will be used for a certain user. "WooCommerce PDF Invoices & Packing Slips" is the plugin which my function hooks into.
You still need to add the template(s) to your child theme. Instead of having one template selected, you can have multiple.

If anyone has requests about having more conditional logic. For example user groups instead of just users. I could integrate this plugin with the "Groups" plugin.
